The Shiny App developed shows the Histograms for Normal and Exponential Distributions where the mean and standard deviations are set to defualt. The sample size range from 100 to 10000, with a step increase of 100 per sample. 

For the Normal Distribution, the data tends to be around a central value, here mean = 10, So Symmetry is around the center with 50% of the values below the mean and 50% of the values above the mean.

For the Exponential Distribution, the values are more streched out as the mean value decreases. The mean here is defualt to 1.
